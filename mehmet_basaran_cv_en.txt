Over the past year, I have thrived as a DevOps engineer, drawing on my solid background in
Linux system administration, infrastructure monitoring, and cluster management. Prior to this,
gained three years of experience as a systems engineer and monitoring specialist, further
deepening my expertise in backend operations.
My key strength lies in driving efficiency and simplifying complex system management. I have
consistently delivered in designing, deploying, and maintaining large-scale Linux environments,
ensuring stability and performance across critical systems.
I have led the implementation of high-availability architectures and managed robust CI/CD
pipelines that streamline software delivery and reduce deployment risks. These efforts have
directly supported agile development teams and enhanced product reliability.
Passionate about operational excellence and automation, I am eager to contribute my skills to
forward-thinking team, where I can help build resilient infrastructure and deliver impactful,
scalable solutions.

Additionally, I have experience in developing LLM-based solutions and utilizing prompt
engineering to automate system operations and human-system interactions, enhancing overall
efficiency and reducing manual workload.
